# Learning about Version Control
Author: Derek Rodgers

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Like: I like that version control means I can be assured I have a full history and I never lose any work.

Dislike: I dislike how clunky resolving merge conflilcts can be, especially manually reconciling the headers in the files.
